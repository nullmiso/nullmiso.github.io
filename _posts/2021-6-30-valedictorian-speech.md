#### A bit of background information

This was a speech that I was unable to deliver to my fellow students at our graduation ceremony due to some unfortunate circumstances. Since I was denied the opportunity to present this in the manner that our decades-long school tradition prescribed, I am hosting it on personal social platforms for the time being. Enjoy :)

#### The speech

Faculty members, family, friends, and fellow graduates of the class of 2021,

It is no small achievement to be here to mark the end of high school. We have all experienced great hardships in the past two years. Today is not only a day to celebrate our success and look forward to our future, but also to show our gratitude to those who have helped us reach this point.

I would like to acknowledge those who supported me; my church, my community, and my family. I thank God for all of you.

I also want to thank my teachers; Ms. Nauss for teaching us the timeless lessons of America’s history; Mrs. Martin, Mrs. Smith, and Mr. Howard for helping us discover our passions for writing and critical thinking; Mrs. Liu and Mr. Sharma, for teaching us the beauty of chemistry and biology; Madame Barbu pour partager avec nous l’amour de la langue français; Mrs. Ciz, Mr. Takacs, and Mrs. Howell, for the challenges and thrills of learning advanced mathematics; Mrs. Olson for challenging our artistic talents; and Coach Ramirez, who taught us that we were not American’s Walking team, but the Cross Country team.

Special thanks to Mr. Shockley, who selflessly shouldered the responsibilities of teaching Physics for two years; and our late Physics teacher Mr. Chan, who dedicated his life to inspire students to pursue science.

Finally, thank you to my friends, Ojasw, Ashwin, Jared, Danton, Emily, Kevin, Siddharth, and countless others, for all the memories we shared here.

Class of 2021, I wish you all the best with your future endeavors. Whether as engineers, scientists, doctors, nurses, or public servants, I hope that we all will give back to our communities and country.

To close, I would like to give some advice for the future. Keep searching for the truth in everything you do; because when you know the truth, the truth will make you free.

Thank you all, congratulations, and God bless.
